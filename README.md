# Sumplete-Solver
I've developed a strategy to efficiently solve Sumplete puzzles, leveraging constraint satisfaction techniques. This approach enables solving puzzles at the highest difficulty level in under 3 seconds. The aim is to provide an optimized solution that can be a valuable resource for those interested in computational puzzle solving.
